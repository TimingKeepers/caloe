\section{Future work}

There are many possibilities to improve the current library. Among others, we can highlight:

\begin{itemize}
 \item {Increase of CALoE library performance.}
 \item {Improve CALoE library error handling.}
 \item {Implement security mechanisms for safer packet delivery.}
 \item {Develop configuration files for new devices.}
 \item {Integrate into a general White-Rabbit network management software including the WR Switch control support}
\end{itemize}

The current code should be interpreted as a proof of concept. 
Future work will be focused on extending these features to more complex/realistic scenarios.
