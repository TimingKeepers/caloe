\section{Conclusion}

CALoE library allows to read remotely board status/data and configure devices and actions. It abstracts the low level properties of the Etherbone core (and its library) and gateware to provide a high level abstraction layer to work with these devices. 

In this document we have shown how CALoE can be used to configure a DIO-FMC card connected to a SPEC board programmed with the WR-NIC gateware.
The possibility of configuring these actions commands just by writing a simple configuration text file helps to simplify and adapt significantly CALoE libraries to new board and gatewares.
