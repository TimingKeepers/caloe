\section{Goals}

The main purpose of CALoE is to allow remote access to the device memory map (based on Wishbone bus) by using Ethernet as well as simplify the generation of simple commands. More concretely, these goals are: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{Hide low level details of Etherbone library. Users do not have to worry about low level features of Etherbone implementation.}
\item{User can define configuration files for his devices with all their operations.}
\item{Provide a high level class implementation for main devices. It hides CALoE library details.}
\end{itemize}
