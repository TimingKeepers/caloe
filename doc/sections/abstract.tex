CALoE (Configuration Abstraction Layer over Etherbone) is a network library that allows to configure several devices remotely.
CALoE library is based on Etherbone and provides a high level abstraction layer in order to ease
configuration procedures. The user has only to write a device configuration file with device operations and use CALoE to execute them.
It is important to note that each device must have a Etherbone core that receives UDP/TCP packets from an Endpoint and sends Whisbone packets to read/write in device memory map.
